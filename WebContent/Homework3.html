<h2 style="color: rgb(179, 106, 106);"> Issues of Uploading file to heroku </h2>
<p> heroku limits the way storing data in to the servers, stroring any data or files are impossible
with out using external claoud service. Heroku have been introduced different stacks to solve this problems , but still
the problem exists. the issue is that when every time  you push updated versions of your application it replace the old ones and all stored data or files
will be lost, since it recreates the application when it gets a new commit.<br> <br> Same thing for file uploading, if you push file to heroku and next time try to commit new files, it will authomatically 
erase the old ones and store the new ones instead.
Generally storing persistent files or data to heroku is impossible. but only if you use external service like, Rackspace Cloud Files or Spideroack, Amazon S3,  you can be able to store persistent files
to heroku dev store.   </p>
